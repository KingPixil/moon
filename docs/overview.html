        <h4 id="what-is-moon-">What is Moon?</h4>
<p>Moon is a minimal, blazing fast library for building user interfaces. It combines the positive aspects of popular libraries into one small package. It&#39;s super lightweight, and includes advanced optimizations to ensure fast render times. The API is small and intuitive, while still remaining powerful.</p>
<p>For example, here is the minified + gzipped size for popular libraries compared to Moon (less is better):</p>
<ul>
<li>Moon - 6kb</li>
<li>Mithril - 8kb</li>
<li>Vue - 25.86kb</li>
<li>React + React DOM - 43kb</li>
<li>Angular 2 - 111kb</li>
</ul>
<p>Update performance (more is better):</p>
<ul>
<li>Moon - 102 repaints/sec</li>
<li>Mithril - 95 repaints/sec</li>
<li>Angular 2 - 62 repaints/sec</li>
<li>Vue - 50 repaints/sec</li>
<li>React - 49 repaints/sec</li>
<li>Angular - 47 repaints/sec</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, Moon is blazing fast compared to other popular libraries.</p>
<p>Moon can also support IE9+ without any polyfills.</p>
<h4 id="another-library-">Another library?</h4>
<p>Yes, there have been a <strong>lot</strong> of front end libraries released, and many people prefer different aspects about each of these libraries. For example, React provides the ability to use JSX and uses a virtual DOM, Angular provides easy to use directives, and Ember provides a nice templating engine built in.</p>
<p>Moon aims to combine all of the good features of these libraries into a single, lightweight package, while providing improved performance.</p>
<h4 id="reactive-data">Reactive Data</h4>
<p>With Moon, all of your data is kept in sync with the DOM, while in React or JQuery, this was a tedious task that had to be done manually.</p>
<p>Moon, on the other hand, has a lightweight templating engine built in, it lets you interpolate data with a simple <code>{{mustache}}</code> template. You can uses these templates anywhere in your app, including attributes!</p>
<p>Take a look at this example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div id=&quot;app1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p style=&quot;color: {{color}}&quot;&gt;Change my Color!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var app1 = new Moon({
  el: &quot;#app1&quot;,
  data: {
    color: &quot;blue&quot;
  }
});
</code></pre>
<div id="app1" class="example">
  <p style="color: {{color}}">Change my Color!</p>
</div>

<script>
var app1 = new Moon({
  el: "#app1",
  data: {
    color: "blue"
  }
});
</script>

<p>As you can see, the paragraph renders with a blue color!
Go ahead, try changing it in the console with <code>app1.set(&#39;color&#39;, &#39;green&#39;)</code></p>
<p>Internally, each instance has an <strong>observer</strong>. Every time you <code>.set</code> a property, the observer is notified of a change, and it will queue a build.</p>
<h4 id="async-queue">Async Queue</h4>
<p>You&#39;ll notice how the observer <em>queues</em> a build. This is to optimize performance by building as less as possible. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">app.set(&#39;count&#39;, 1);
app.set(&#39;count&#39;, 2);
app.set(&#39;count&#39;, 3);
</code></pre>
<p>If you created an app with a <code>count</code> property in the data, and ran this code, Moon would only update once. Why? Moon pushes this build to a queue, and if it is not building already, then it will run a build. If not, it will wait until all the data in the current block is set, then build.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to see the DOM after an update is queued, you can use <code>Moon.nextTick</code> like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">Moon.nextTick(function() {
  // manipulate the DOM
});
</code></pre>
<h4 id="directives">Directives</h4>
<p>Angular provided a lot of helpful directives that could perform a variety of tasks. Moon has directives built in as well, and can be used to conditionally render items, to render lists, to attach event listeners, to skip updating, and more!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at a practical example: What if you need to display a &quot;Profile&quot; link if a user is signed in? How would you update if the user signed out?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div id=&quot;app2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p m-if=&quot;{{signedIn}}&quot;&gt;Profile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var app2 = new Moon({
  el: &quot;#app2&quot;,
  data: {
    signedIn: true
  }
});
</code></pre>
<div id="app2" class="example">
  <p m-if="{{signedIn}}">Profile</p>
</div>

<script>
var app2 = new Moon({
  el: "#app2",
  data: {
    signedIn: true
  }
});
</script>

<p>Now, if you detected the user has signed out, the <code>m-if</code> directive will handle this, try it yourself!</p>
<p>Type <code>app2.set(&#39;signedIn&#39;, false)</code> in the console, and watch the DOM being updated!</p>
<p>Directives always have a prefix of <code>m-</code>, and this prefix can be set in <code>Moon.config.prefix</code>.</p>
<h4 id="components">Components</h4>
<p>Components are super useful, allowing you to reuse certain elements of your app. Moon has a component system like React/Vue, allowing you to compose entire applications with components.</p>
<p>Each component is a mini Moon instance, that the diff engine treats differently.</p>
<p>Like React, Moon also offers stateless functional components with just a render function. These provide a performance boost when diffing.</p>
<p>Regular components are optimized by default, you have to do no work. It&#39;s like the <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> hook in React is already implemented for you by Moon&#39;s smart rendering engine.</p>
<p>If you have multiple components, but only update one, only that component will be updated.</p>
<p>Moon&#39;s components also have a <strong>slot</strong> system, allowing you to render the HTML that was inside the component being rendered.</p>
<p>Here is how an app that uses components might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;App&gt;
  &lt;Header&gt;Some Content&lt;/Header&gt;
  &lt;Content&gt;Body Content&lt;/Content&gt;
  &lt;List items=&quot;{{items}}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/App&gt;
</code></pre>

### About

Moon is a simple front end JavaScript library heavily inspired by [Vue](https://vuejs.org). The library is fast, flexible, and easy to learn. Check out the [Medium Article](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-moon-1d44a99635f0) for more information on why I made this.

### Extras

* âœ¨ [moon-cli](https://github.com/kbrsh/moon-cli) - scaffold a feature rich project
* ðŸš© [moon-router](https://github.com/kbrsh/moon-router) - fast component router
* ðŸ“‹ [monx](https://github.com/kbrsh/monx) - clean state management
* ðŸŒŽ [moon-ssr](https://github.com/kbrsh/moon-ssr) - universal server-side rendering
* ðŸ“Š [moon-bars](https://kbrsh.github.io/moon-bars) - beautiful bar graph component

### Another library?

There have been a lot of JavaScript libraries released lately. Moon has been developed since late 2015. Most libraries are bloated, with a complex API and large file size, leading to applications becoming slower, and less mobile friendly.

Moon differs from the existing solutions by providing a faster, yet compact library with a simple but powerful API. It uses a compiler that uses advanced optimizations to create performant functions for generating virtual DOM trees. The virtual DOM engine uses these trees to efficiently update the DOM. In a variety of benchmarks, Moon has proven itself to be one of the fastest UI libraries out there.

Still, you do not have to use Moon if you are happy with your current solution, or if you have already started a project without it. Feel free to use it if you are creating something new, need performance gains, like the intuitive API, or are simply curious.
